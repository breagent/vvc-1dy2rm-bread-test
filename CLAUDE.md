### Project Overview
- **Name**: Bread Test
- **Description**: An extremely simple static HTML page featuring a massive bread emoji centered on a white background
- **Type**: Static HTML Page
- **Status**: New Project
- **Phone**: 16503500601
- **GitHub Repository**: To be created

### Core Intent
- **Primary Goal**: Create the simplest possible webpage with just a bread emoji
- **Problem Solved**: Provides a minimalist test page or demonstration of ultra-simple web design
- **Target Audience**: Developer testing or anyone who appreciates minimalist design
- **Value Proposition**: Ultimate simplicity - no distractions, just a bread emoji

### Features & Functionality

#### Must-Have Features
1. **Massive Bread Emoji**: Display a bread emoji (üçû) that fills the entire screen
   - Acceptance: The bread emoji should be the dominant visual element, taking up most of the viewport
2. **Centered Positioning**: The emoji must be perfectly centered both horizontally and vertically
   - Acceptance: The emoji appears in the exact center of the screen regardless of screen size
3. **White Background**: Pure white background with no other colors or elements
   - Acceptance: Background color is #FFFFFF with no gradients or patterns
4. **Static HTML**: Must be a simple, static HTML file with no dependencies
   - Acceptance: Single HTML file that works without any external resources

#### Should-Have Features
1. **Responsive Sizing**: The emoji should scale appropriately on different screen sizes
2. **Clean Code**: Minimal, readable HTML with inline CSS

#### Nice-to-Have Features
None specified - user emphasized "nothing else"

### Design Preferences
- **Style**: Ultra-minimalist
- **Tone**: Simple, clean, uncluttered
- **Examples**: None mentioned
- **Colors**: White background only
- **Imagery**: Single bread emoji (üçû)

### Technical Requirements
- **Platform**: Web browser (any modern browser)
- **Performance**: Should load instantly due to simplicity
- **Accessibility**: Simple enough to be universally accessible
- **Integrations**: None
- **Constraints**: Must be static HTML, no JavaScript, no frameworks

### Assumptions & Clarifications

#### Assumptions Made
1. **Emoji Size**: "Massive" and "fill the entire screen" means the emoji should be as large as possible while remaining visible
   - Alternative: Could mean literally 100vh/100vw, but this might crop the emoji
2. **File Name**: Should be index.html for standard web hosting
   - Alternative: Could be named bread-test.html to match project name
3. **Font Size Approach**: Will use CSS font-size with viewport units (vw/vh) for responsive scaling
   - Alternative: Could use a fixed pixel size, but this wouldn't be responsive

#### Clarifications Needed
None - the user confirmed they provided all necessary information

### Update Details (if applicable)
Not applicable - this is a new project
